This is a demo app that fetches 20 books per pagination from gutendex using Clean Architecture with MVVM architectural pattern. The dependancy flow goes like View → ViewModel → Use Case → Repository → Service. Kingfisher is used for retrieving and storing images locally. Swift Concurrency is used for network calls. Data Transfer Object is responsible for mapping the decoded json and then we use User as the Domain Model to call only values we do care about.
